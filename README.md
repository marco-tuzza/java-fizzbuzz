# Java FizzBuzz
This is a simple Java program that implements the popular game FizzBuzz. The program uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 100. For each iteration, the program checks if the current number is divisible by 15, 5, and 3, and prints the corresponding string. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, the program simply prints the number itself.

To run the program, compile and run the `FizzBuzz.java` file.
```java
javac FizzBuzz.java
java FizzBuzz
```
The program should output the numbers 1 to 100, with the numbers divisible by 3, 5, and 15 replaced with the corresponding FizzBuzz strings.
